# 🚀 Python Adventure: From Zero to Hero

Welcome to the Python Adventure: From Zero to Hero! 🏆 <br> 
This repository is designed for curious minds who want to level up their Python skills <br> 

# 📌 Projects in This Adventure

## (1) py-from-zero-to-hero-01 
### 🖥️ What is it? 
A console-based CRUD application built with Python and SQLite, that contains concepts of: 
- Connecting Python to SQLite 🗄️ 
- Performing Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations ✍️ 
- Running an interactive command-line interface 🏗️ 

## (2) py-from-zero-to-hero-02 
### 🌍 What is it? 
A Flask-based web API with best practices for: 
- Handling CRUD operations for user management 🛠️ 
- Managing configurations with .env and separate dev/prod settings 🔧 
- Running a Dockerized Flask API for scalable deployment 🐳 
- Using SQLAlchemy for database interactions 📊 

## (3) py-from-zero-to-hero-03
### 🤖 What is it?
Building upon everything we accomplished in the previous project, we are now expanding our API with new features as we embark on our journey into the world of LLMs. The enhancements include:

- Utilizing an LLM to determine the topic the user is inquiring about.
- Once the topic is identified, the application attempts to find an answer by scanning the contents of a folder.
- If the topic is not found within the folder's content, the application queries the database to retrieve information related to the user's purchase.
- Lastly, if the user initiates a topic that is not covered by the API, the application returns an appropriate error response.

## (4) py-from-zero-to-hero-04
### 🗨️🤖 What is it?
In this final module, we will introduce this fantastic library. 
Instead of manually sending JSON requests to our API, 
we'll leverage a chat assistant to help us to extract the backend information we need more efficiently.

## (5) py-from-zero-to-hero-05
### 🧠💾 What is it?
This project combines RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with LLMs and local vector databases for intelligent document retrieval. The enhancements include:

- Building a Chroma vector database from documents for semantic search 🔍
- Implementing RAG pipelines to retrieve and augment LLM responses with relevant context 📚
- Integrating Ollama for local LLM inference without external API dependencies 🏠
- Managing conversation memory and context across multiple chat interactions 💬
- Using Flask to expose chat and query endpoints with intelligent document retrieval 🌐
- Handling embeddings and document chunking with LangChain utilities 🧩

## (6) py-from-zero-to-hero-06
### 🐳🚀 What is it?
This is the production-ready version of the RAG/LLM API with enterprise-grade enhancements:

- Dockerized deployment for consistent environments across development and production 📦
- Redis integration for caching and session management 💾
- Flask-RESTX for structured REST API documentation and swagger support 📖
- Enhanced profanity filtering and content moderation with better-profanity 🛡️
- Input validation and sanitization for security 🔐
- Modular project structure with separate database, model, and resource layers 🏗️
- Production WSGI server (Waitress) instead of Flask's development server 🔧
- Comprehensive Docker orchestration with Redis, Ollama, and Flask containers 🐋

## (7) py-from-zero-to-hero-07
### 🧑‍🏫🤖 What is it?
A multi-agent chat demo using AutoGen with Ollama as the local LLM backend, focused on teacher/student pedagogy:

- Multi-agent role behavior with distinct personas via system messages 🎭
- Conversation flow management between student and teacher agents 💬
- Ollama integration for local inference (llama3.2) 🧠
- Temperature control differences per agent 🔥

## (8) py-from-zero-to-hero-08
### 🛒🧰 What is it?
A multi-agent shopping cart system that showcases the tool-use design pattern with AutoGen + Ollama:

- Dedicated agents for discovery, checkout, and orchestration (ShoppingAssistant, CatalogAgent, CheckoutAgent) 🤖
- Tool-use pattern: LLMs propose tool calls while a user proxy executes them for real API-like actions 🧠
- Mocked services for catalog, payments, delivery locations, cart, and checkout to simulate backend APIs 🧩
- Structured validation and constraints (country-based availability, PT-only delivery, payment checks) ✅

## (9) py-from-zero-to-hero-09
### 🛒🤝 What is it?
A true multi-agent shopping cart system using AutoGen GroupChat + Ollama:

- Multiple agents actively collaborate in the same conversation (ShoppingAssistant, CatalogAgent, CheckoutAgent) 🤖
- GroupChatManager orchestrates turn-taking across specialists in one shared thread 🧠
- The user proxy executes tool calls while agents plan and coordinate actions 🧰
- Mocked services for catalog, payments, delivery locations, cart, and checkout to simulate backend APIs 🧩
- Structured validation and constraints (country-based availability, PT-only delivery, payment checks) ✅
